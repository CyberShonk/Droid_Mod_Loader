# Droid Mod Loader Troubleshooting

## DML cannot use my game folder

Check these first:

1. Confirm DML has Android **Manage all files** access.
2. Use a shared storage path that DML can read and write directly.
3. Confirm you selected the correct game `Data` folder and Game Root for the active profile.
4. Do not select another application's protected private `Android/data` directory.
5. Select the folder again if the profile came from an older DML build that used URI storage.

Android may protect another application's private storage even when DML has
all files access.

## The deployment target is rejected

DML distinguishes Data and Game Root and checks game markers before physical
deployment.

A target can be rejected because it:

- belongs to another supported game;
- uses the wrong target role;
- is a broad storage parent instead of a game folder;
- cannot be read or written safely; or
- does not match the selected Data/Game Root installation pair.

Stop and select the intended folders rather than bypassing the warning.

## A mod imports but does not appear in the game

Check:

1. The mod installation completed successfully.
2. The mod is enabled in the active profile.
3. The active profile points to the intended game folders.
4. The mod's files are deployable game content rather than documentation or other files used only by the manager.
5. A normal deployment completed after the mod state changed.
6. Any plugin supplied by the mod is enabled when required.

If the physical target was changed outside DML and its state is uncertain, use
the available recovery or full redeploy tools rather than assuming the existing
manifest proves every physical file is still correct.

## A plugin is missing or has the wrong order

Confirm the enabled mod actually contains the plugin and that the plugin is
supported by the selected game.

For Skyrim Legendary Edition, inspect `plugins.txt` and `loadorder.txt` behavior.
For Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and TTW, ordering is applied through
plugin modification timestamps and requires a writable Data folder.

Review DML's plugin warnings before changing files manually.

## DML reports an unfinished deployment

An unfinished journal means the previous deployment may not have completed
cleanly.

1. Review the warning before starting another deployment.
2. Confirm the active profile and selected target are the ones you intend to repair.
3. Use DML's recovery or full redeploy tools when appropriate.
4. Do not manually delete deployment state just to remove the warning.

An unfinished deployment record is safety information. Preserve it until you
understand the interrupted operation.

## An archive is rejected

DML identifies archive format from its signature, not just the filename.

Common unsupported cases include:

- RAR5 installation;
- archives protected by a password or encrypted archives;
- multipart RAR archives; and
- uncommon unsupported 7z variants.

A large archive is not automatically invalid. If an install crashes or exits,
report the actual format and any diagnostics rather than assuming file size was
the cause.

## The game crashes after deployment

A successful file copy does not guarantee that a mod list is valid for the game.
Check for missing masters, incompatible mods, plugin order problems, wrong target
selection, and unmanaged/manual files that conflict with the managed setup.

Test changes with backups and a disposable profile or a profile known to work
where practical.

## Reporting a problem

Include:

- DML version;
- device model and Android version;
- game and compatibility environment;
- active profile;
- selected target type and path class without exposing private information;
- archive format if the problem involves installation;
- exact reproduction steps;
- what you expected and what happened; and
- relevant screenshots, DML diagnostics, or logs with sensitive data removed.
